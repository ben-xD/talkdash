# TalkDash

Tools for event hosts and presenters. Available on https://talkdash.pages.dev

- Message event speakers whilst they talk. Messages will appear on the app. For example, remind them to **repeat the question** asked by someone. 
- Adjust time remaining for the speaker remotely.

Still in development. It currently only shows the time elapsed and time remaining.
