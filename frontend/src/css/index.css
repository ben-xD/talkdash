/*While it's easier to write custom classes in your .css file, I'd recommend doing so in the tailwind.config.js
as it's compatible with the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense VS Code extension which gives you autocomplete
and hover preview. https://www.themosaad.com/blog/two-years-of-tailwind-css
I guess this refers to writing a plugin that defines more component styles (classes).
See https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#writing-plugins
With custom classes in css, I have intellisense, but probably from Webstorm instead of tailwind, with no hover preview.
